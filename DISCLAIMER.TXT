Disclaimer for BVotifier.

I (Cory Redmond), did not create Votifier.

These plugins contain content from Votifier, and also an edited version of the plugin.

Votifier and all the code from these two plugins are both under the General Public Licence V3.0, 
which can be found inside the jar as LICENCE.TXT

Thanks a lot.
